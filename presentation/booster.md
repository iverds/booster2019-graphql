# Motivation

- Reflect on how you fetch data from a client
- Try out GraphQL
- Make you curious

---

# Agenda

1. Introduction
2. GraphQL. What is it?
3. Queries
4. Mutations
5. Subscriptions

# Challenges with REST

- Hard to do correctly (for me at least)
- Often ends up with REST-ish endpoints
- Underfetching and Overfetching

---

# Case: Sports application

- Clubs
- Players
- Fixtures
- Goals

---

# Two pages:

- One with one club, list of players and last five fixtures
- One with all the clubs, and their last fixture including goal scorer names

---

# With REST

- `/clubs`
- `/clubs/{id}`
- `/clubs/{id}/players`
- `/clubs/{id}/season_fixtures`
- `/season_fixtures/{id}/goals`
- `/goals/{id}/player`

---

# `/clubs`

```javascript
[
    {
        id: 1,
        name: "Arsenal",
        club_code: "ARS",
        stadium: "Emirates Stadium",
        capacity: 59867,
        manager: "Unai Emery",
        manager_nationality: "Spain",
        position: 5,
        players: { href: "/api/clubs/1/players" },
        season_fixtures: { href: "/api/clubs/1/fixtures" }
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        name: "Bournemouth",
        club_code: "BOU",
        stadium: "Vitality Stadium",
        capacity: 11360,
        manager: "Eddie Howe",
        manager_nationality: "England",
        position: 12,
        players: { href: "/api/clubs/2/players" },
        season_fixtures: { href: "/api/clubs/2/fixtures" }
    },
]
```

---

# REST(ish)

- `/GetClubWithPlayersAndLastFiveFixturesById`
- `/GetClubsWithFixtures`
- `/GetClubsWithLastFixtureAndGoalsForThat`

---

## Underfetching
- An endpoint doesn't provide enough information
- N+1 problem

## Overfetching
- We get a lot of data that we don't need

---

# GraphQL. What is it?

---

# GraphQL. What is it?

- It lets us specify the the data we need in a query
- Easy to write correctly
- Schema and typing
- No silver bullet

---

# Demo

---

# How it works

- Operations
- Schema
- Resolvers

---

# Operations

- `query`: Query for data
- `mutation`: Create or update and then return some data
- `subscription`: Subscribe on data changes

---


# Query and response

[.code-highlight: none]
[.code-highlight: 1-5]
[.code-highlight: 7-11]
```javascript
fetch('graphql', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query: '{ hello }' }),
})

{
    "data": {
        "hello": "Hello World!"
    }
}
```

---

# Schema

[.code-highlight: none]
[.code-highlight: 2]
[.code-highlight: 3]
[.code-highlight: 4]
[.code-highlight: 5]
[.code-highlight: 6]

```javascript
type Query {
    id: ID
    hello: String!
    number: Int
    float: Float
    isTrue: Boolean
}
```

---

# Resolver

[.code-highlight: none]
[.code-highlight: 3]
[.code-highlight: 4]
[.code-highlight: 5]
[.code-highlight: 6]
[.code-highlight: 7]
```javascript
const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        id: (parent, args, context, info) => 1,
        hello: () => 'Hello World!',
        number: () => 12345,
        float: () => 123.45,
        isTrue: () => true
    }
}
```

---

# Resolver

```javascript
id: (parent, args, context, info) => 1,
```
- `parent`: The parent object (often not used on root query)
- `args`: Input arguments to the graphql query/mutation
- `context`: Request-spesific information like current user and database connection
- `info`:  Field-specific information

# Task 1 - A simple query

Create a simple query that returns one or more of the built in scalars (like ID, String, Int, Float or Boolean)

- `git clone https://github.com/iverds/booster2019-graphql`
- `npm install`
- `npm start` - `localhost:4000`
- `src/task1/task1.graphql`: Schema
- `src/task1/task1.js`: Resolver

}
```

# Task 2 - Parameterized queries

1. Create a query that return a club by name
2. Create a query that returns a club based on a Search input type

- Get data from `data.js` (Thanks to https://github.com/drraq)
- `const { clubs } = require('./data')` 
- Remember to change reference in `server.js` to 
`require('./task2/task2')`

- N+1 SQL (or other data) queries
- Multiple queries for same resource

---

# Dataloader

- Batches up multiple requests, and execute as one request
- Caches data during the lifetime of a request
- Based on one function that take an array of keys
- The Array of values returned must be the same length as the Array of keys.
- Each index in the Array of values must correspond to the same index in the Array of keys.

const getFriendsByUserIds = userIds => {
    return Promise.resolve(userIds.map(k => k + 1))

# Task 6 - Dataloader

1. Change calls for nested resources to use dataloader

---

# Pitfalls

---
# Endless queries

```javascript
query {
    humans {
        name
        friends {
            name
            friends {
                name
                friends { name friends { friends { friends { }}}}
            }
        }
    }

# Authorization

- Common vulnerability in graphql-endpoints
- The `context` parameter is a perfect place for resolving user information
- Think of authorization in every resolver

# Authorization

```javascript
const resolvers = {

            return getFriendsForUser(parent.id)
                .filter(user => currentUser.friends.some(f => f.id === user.id))
        }
    }
}
```

---

# Task 7 - Authorization

1. Create a method `getUser` that return a user, which have a list of club ids
2. Set a static user id on the context
3. Change the club resolver to only return clubs the user have access to

```javascript
{
    id: 1,
    name: 'Trener Trenersen',
    club_ids: [1, 2, 3]
}
```
